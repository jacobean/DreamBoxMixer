# DreamBox Mixer

DreamBox Mixer is a javascript plugin that renders a virtual dreambox to a HTML5 canvas element.

## Developer Setup

You need a webserver to get the game running locally. If you have Python 3 installed you can simply run `python -m http.server` in the project directory from a command line prompt and then navigate to `localhost:8000` in the browser. Any webserver will work though.
